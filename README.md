# Fluid Flow Dynamics through the Endothelial Glycocalyx

This project investigates the dynamics of blood flow through the endothelial glycocalyx, a critical structure on the vascular endothelium involved in regulating vascular permeability and protecting against mechanical stress. Using a combination of **Ansys simulations** and **SolidWorks-designed 3D models**, the study explores the effects of varying glycocalyx configurations on fluid flow characteristics.

## Project Goals
- **Primary Objective**: To understand how the structural configuration of the glycocalyx influences blood flow patterns, wall shear stress, and pressure distribution under different conditions.
- **Methodology**: 
  - **Experimental**: Dye flow visualization through 3D-printed glycocalyx models with varying configurations.
  - **Computational**: Navier-Stokes-based simulations using Ansys for glycocalyx models to analyze flow dynamics.

## Results
- **Experimental Observations**: Dye flow visualization showed increased velocity with reduced spacing between structures, reflecting fundamental flow principles.
- **Simulation Results**: Computational results at low Reynolds numbers revealed decreased velocity with reduced spacing, providing insights into the protective function of tightly packed glycocalyx.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Tightly packed structures reduce wall shear stress, potentially protecting endothelial cells from high mechanical forces.
  - Discrepancies between experimental and computational methods highlight the complexity of flow dynamics and the need for advanced modeling.

## Repository Contents
- **SolidWorks Models**: 3D models of glycocalyx structures with and without side chains.
- **Ansys Simulation Files**: Setups and results for CFD simulations.
